Koala Holla
===========

Our client, Koala Holla (1976 Llama Comma Drive, Walla Walla WA) is a non-profit dedicated to the ethical transitioning of koalas from the outdoors (whereupon they may be rained) to urban areas where roofs exist. Our team was hired to build a web app to handle their terrarium residents. TO KEEP THE POOR KOALAS DRY!

########## Application Function #######

We created an app that adds a Koala to the database, makes a form with the appropriate info, and saves the koala in the database. 

We added the ability to mark a Koala ready for transfer. Each koala in the UI has a button that reads 'Ready for Transfer'. When the user clicks on the button, it updates the database for the specific Koala. The 'Ready for Transfer' button only appears for Koalas that haven't yet been marked ready for transfer.
